The Matlab script kalmanAuto can be used to find the best
fit parameters of the model to the behavior data. To see how to use 
it, type in Matlab: "help kalmanAuto", and to see an example, 
type:
"kalmanAuto('example');"

In the tool box, following files should be included:

README                  softmax.m		kalman.m
kalmanAuto.m		kalmanIndv.m		resultplot.m
example.mat

For execution, the file README is not necessary.
