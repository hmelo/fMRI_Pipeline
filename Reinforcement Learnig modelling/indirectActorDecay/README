The Matlab script indirectActorAuto can be used to find the best
fit parameters of the model to the behavior data. To see how to use 
it, type in Matlab: "help indirectActor2Auto", and to see an example, 
type:
"indirectActor2Auto('example');"

In the tool box, following files should be included:

README                  softmax.m		indirectActor2.m
indirectActor2Auto.m    indirectActor2Indv.m    resultplot.m
example.mat

For execution, the file README is not necessary.
